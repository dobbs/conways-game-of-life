Conway's Game of Life in Javascript
===================================

I attended a [Code Retreat in Boulder on February 26, 2011](http://prakash.eventwax.com/code-retreat-boulder).

Then I couldn't let go of the problem.  I've wanted to play with
cellular automata since I first learned of them.  So I test drove this
implementation over several hours this weekend when I should have been
sleeping.  I also very intentionally committed the code in very, very
small steps so I will have an example I can refer to when I want to
explain test driven development.
